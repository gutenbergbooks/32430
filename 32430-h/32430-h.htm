<p><span class="smcap">Welcome</span>, merry Christmas and New-Year!
prized by children above all other
days in the year. Ye are associated
with pleasant recollections of old Santa
Claus and sugar-plums&mdash;with bright visions
of a cheerful fireside, merry games,
pleasant stories, and happy, smiling faces.
First comes Christmas Eve, when
each young face beams with eager curiosity
and delightful anticipation&mdash;all
wondering and guessing what they shall
find in their stockings next morning;
while the eldest sister, with looks of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>mystery and of importance, shares her
mother's councils, and helps to distribute
the precious stores. Soon they are in
bed, anxious to sleep off the long hours,
dreaming of rocking-horses and doll-babies,
tea-sets, wooden soldiers, and all
the other delights of the toy-shop.</p>

<p>I never heard of a lazy child on a
Christmas morning. The idle and the
industrious are all up, "bright and early."
The well-filled stockings are eagerly
inspected, good wishes and pretty
or useful presents given and received,
and various plans proposed for the day's
amusement. Night comes too soon for
the tireless lovers of fun, who go unwillingly
to bed, consoling themselves that
one week more will bring New-Year.</p>

<p>Dear children, long may such innocent
delights crown the year; and, in
the midst of all, forget not the children
of the famishing poor, who have no
Christmas pleasures to look forward to;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>whose parents toil for their daily bread
and scanty apparel all the year, and have
no time nor means to provide themselves
or their children with the comforts and
luxuries you enjoy. Each one can spare
a little to minister to the enjoyment of
those poor suffering children, many of
whom, perhaps, have no fathers to provide
for them, some of them not even a
home to shelter them. Share with them
your abundance, and the blessings of the
poor shall rest upon you. And now, my
patient little readers, for the story.</p>

<p>One Christmas night we were all gathered
around a cheerful fire in the old-fashioned
parlor. Father, mother, sisters,
brothers, uncles, aunts, and cousins,
were all there. The blazing pine knots
sent a cheerful light into every nook and
corner of the big room; the ponderous
presses, and quaint old desk and bookcase,
reflecting the warm glow from their
polished surfaces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>The straight, high-backed, mahogany
chairs had been sadly knocked about in
a game of blind-man's-buff, and looked
as much out of place as a prim old
maiden aunt in a game of romps. Nut-shells
and apple-parings, kiss-papers and
mottoes, strewed the broad hearth, and
gave pretty good token of the evening's
cheer. The clock had just struck ten,
and we youngsters were warned that it
was bedtime, when there arose a loud
call for a story. A story from Uncle
Ned! We might all sit up to hear a
story, if Uncle Ned would tell one.</p>

<p>He, good soul, never refused a kind
request in his life, and we felt quite safe
for the next half hour. I think I see
him now, with his trim leg encased in a
fine home-knit stocking&mdash;his bright shoe-buckles,
and neat drab small-clothes&mdash;his
queer-looking continental hat, with
his gray locks appearing beneath it,
and his hands resting upon the head of
his silver-mounted cane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h3>UNCLE NED'S STORY.</h3>

<p>"Many years ago, when I was a slip
of a lad like Tom there"&mdash;"Why, uncle,"
cried little Willy in amazement,
"did you say you were no bigger than
Tom? Were you ever as little as Tom,
uncle?"&mdash;"Hush, Willy," said Tom, a
well-grown boy of fourteen, "I'm sure
you need not make such a wonderment
at that; I am not so very small, and I
expect to be as big as Uncle Ned when
I'm a man. How naughty of you to
interrupt the story!"</p>

<p>"Well, Willy," said Uncle Ned, "I
don't suppose I look much now as if I
had once been a slender lad, with a soft
fair brow, and rosy cheeks; but I was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
full of fun and frolic as the best of you.
I will tell you how I once came near
losing my own life and that of a friend
and playmate, by my love of mischief.
It was a Christmas night. We were
gathered round the fire just as we now
are, cracking nuts, eating apples, and
telling stories, when I proposed to Jack
Thornton, and his little brother, that we
should go for a skating frolic to 'the
pond,' a beautiful sheet of water about a
quarter of a mile distant. Instantly we
were in motion, looking up our skates
and mittens. Off we started, in high
glee, promising ourselves fine fun on the
ice. The moon shone brilliantly&mdash;every
object could be seen with perfect distinctness.
The little pond, which was
supplied with the purest spring water,
looked like a sheet of silver, sparkling in
the moonlight. I well remember looking
down through the clear and beautifully
transparent ice, and seeing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pond-lilies, with their broad leaves of
tender green, mingled with rushes and
long grass, while the little fish danced
like beams of silver-light in the clear water.
The pond was of no great extent,
but toward the middle it was quite deep,
and formed a fine broad sheet of ice for
skating.</p>

<span class="caption">Ned rescuing Jack from drowning.</span>
</div>

<p>"I remembered having seen the day
before an air-hole near a rock on the
opposite shore. I had tried the ice near
it, and found it strong enough to bear
my weight; and concluding that by this
time it was quite thick enough to bear
two or three, I determined to play a trick
upon Jack, who was exceedingly good
natured, but a great brag. Nobody could
outwit him, he thought. 'Come, Jack,'
said I, 'follow me, and I will take you
where you are afraid to go.'&mdash;'I afraid!'
said he, 'catch me afraid&mdash;I can go anywhere
you can&mdash;go ahead!' Away we
shot, like swallows, toward the fatal air-hole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
'Follow me,' I cried; 'keep up
with me if you can.' Thus stimulated,
Jack kept close in my rear. My object
was to avoid the air-hole myself, and
just give one of Jack's legs a ducking,
without doing him any further injury.
We wheeled in circles round and round,
until, making a quick sweep, and calling
upon him to keep close, I dexterously
made a slight curve so as to avoid the
hole, but down went poor Jack, one leg
and foot quite buried in the freezing element.
It was a favorite trick with the
knowing ones, and was never taken
amiss. But in this case the joke was
carried too far. Jack pulled and struggled
to draw out his foot, when suddenly
the ice gave way, and down he sank into
the deep water. I knew he could not
swim&mdash;neither could I. I was aware it
would not do to attempt to get him out
by going near him on the ice, as our efforts
would only crack the ice and throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
me in too. But, as quick as thought, I
ran on shore, threw off my skates, went
to the edge of the rock, where fortunately
he was within my reach, and, after
many unsuccessful attempts, I succeeded
in drawing him out. Poor Jack was almost
exhausted; but I got him home,
and he was undressed and put to bed.
A severe fit of sickness followed from
the cold he took that night. Aunt Dorothy
always insisted that his sickness
might have been prevented, if she had
been permitted to give him a dose of
her hot-drops, which she always kept by
her&mdash;a specific for all complaints. But
the physician who was called positively
forbade it. Physicians do not like to
have persons who are ignorant of the nature
of diseases, and their proper remedies,
tampering with the human frame.
Although in some instances they may
relieve in mild attacks, they often do a
great deal of harm by giving favorite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
quack medicines, indiscriminately, for all
complaints. However, by good nursing,
Jack soon got well; and we received a
good lesson, which I have never forgotten,
in the almost fatal termination of the
'<span class="smcap">practical joke</span>.'"</p>
